The Noise is the third boss in Pizza Tower, and an upcoming playable character.

The Noise is a short, mischievous gremlin who seems similar to a human being. He dons a yellow jumpsuit and chef hat, an orange cape, and white gloves. He has a long nose, a thin, curled mustache, and a single bucktooth.

His mannerisms are usually giddy, energetic and child-like. He frequently summons random, often wacky objects out of thin air, as seen in his movesets. Despite his goofy nature and appearance, he can become frighteningly demonic if angered.
