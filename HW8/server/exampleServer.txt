Pepperman is the first boss in Pizza Tower.

Pepperman is a giant red bell pepper with limbs wearing a pair of white gloves and sneakers of the same color. Pepperman has big, blue eyes and is frequently seen sporting a great, confident grin on his face showing his teeth. His stem has shown to sometimes turn into a beret whenever he's focused in his artwork or admiring others' work.

His Boss Fight portrait depicts him in a more humanoid appearance and wearing a darker shade of red T-Shirt under a white artistic apron.

During fights in older demos, he would change colors to orange, and then to light yellow depending on how many times he has been hit.
