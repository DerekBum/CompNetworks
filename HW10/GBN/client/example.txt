Minos Prime is the second boss of [ P-1: SOUL SURVIVOR ], released from the Flesh Prison upon its destruction. Though he proclaims his gratitude to V1 for rescuing him, he condemns V1 to death for the machines' crimes against humanity. He is considered the most complex and difficult boss of Act I.

Minos Prime is the first Prime Soul boss, of presumably three, with the second one being Sisyphus Prime.

Minos Prime is a tall, luminescent humanoid. His translucent body gives a clear view of his circulatory system, which seems to be the only organs present. There is a hole where his face should be, and he wears a large crown like the one worn by his deceased Husk. Twin serpents can be seen coiled around his arms.

He spawns after defeating Flesh Prison, as he was trapped within it by the angels after being killed by Gabriel before the beginning of the game.

Minos Prime is an incredibly powerful enemy, capable of chaining attacks to kill V1 in seconds. It only takes a moment of inattention to be utterly destroyed.
